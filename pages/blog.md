Initially I was hoping to integrate a blog-like capability into this website, using MDwiki's 'iframe' gimmick.  The X webpage demonstrates this in their blog.md file:

```
bob
```

Unfortunately this utterly failed when I tested this out, using exactly the same code and then later with 'example.com' as the test domain. Since the point of this web site is have an easy way to collect, manage, and share content and work - and **not** to spend an inordinate amount of time building the web site itself - I'm just letting that go for the moment. I'll do just fine writing notes here with date+time stamps.
