Initially I was hoping to integrate a blog-like capability into this website, using MDwiki's 'iframe' gimmick.  The http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!blog.md webpage demonstrates this with a page that consists of nothing but the following:

```
[gimmick:iframe](http://dynalon.tumblr.com/tagged/MDwiki)
```

Unfortunately this utterly failed when I tested this out by using exactly that same code and then  with 'example.com' as the test domain. Since the point of this web site is have an easy way to collect, manage, and share content and work - and **not** to spend an inordinate amount of time building the web site itself - I'm just letting that go for the moment. I'll do just fine writing notes here with date+time stamps.
