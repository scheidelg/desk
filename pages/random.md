# Random

 * I don't like the default point sizes for H1, H2, H3 using the MDwiki styles; they're too big.  But I can't just use H2 instead of H1, H3 instead of H2 for the md files because MDwiki builds the layout based on the heading styles (e.g., automatically adding a line beneath the first H1; building the sidemenu off of H2 paragraphs).  Come back to this later and adjust the style sheet (for slate, that's the one that I'm using) so that H1 is formatted as the out-of-the-box H2, H2 is formatted as the OOTB H3, etc.
 
 * Change default style so that the column width for main content on a page is smaller (i.e., decrease left and right margins).  That's a *lot* of wasted space to the left and right of the floating sidemenu and main content.
 
 * Change default style for slate (the theme I'm using) to have text be white-on-black instead of grey-on-black.
 
 * Add default 'Navigation' or 'See Also' at the bottom of each page.
 
 * Markdown notes: external HREF's opening in a separate page; space between items in a bullet list
 
  * Create new style for the timestamp footers on each page (smaller font size, italics, top border); test it out; add to ./index.md and all ./pages/x.md files
