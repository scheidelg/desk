# Markdown Notes x

This is a collection of notes, tips, and rules for me when using markdown (primarily on this web site with MDwiki).

A quick reference for things I've used (or started to use) frequently:

 * italics: single asterisks around text: `*text*`
 * bold: double asterisks around text: `**text**`
 * code inline with text: single backticks around text: `` `text` ``
 * code blocks: indent lines (optional for blank lines in the middle of the code block) with four spaces; or open and close the code block with three backticks: ```` ```text``` ````
 * right-align text: `<p align="right">text</p>`
