# Markdown Notes

This is a collection of notes, tips, and rules for me when using markdown (primarily on this web site with MDwiki).

 * italics: single asterisks around text: ```*text*```
 * bold: double asterisks around text: ```**text**```
 * code inline with text: three backticks before, three backticks after: ```&grave;&grave;&grave;text&grave;&grave;&grave;```
 * right-align text: ```<p align="right">text</p>```
