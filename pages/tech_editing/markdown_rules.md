# Markdown Rules

This is a collection of rules for me to follow when using markdown (primarily on this web site with MDwiki).

## My Rules

(my rules here)

external hrefs using `<span></span>` and opening in blank window or tab

horizontal line break between H2 sections

bulleted lists with spaces between them

timestamp footers.

<hr class="tight"><p class="timestamp" id="timestamp"></p>
<script type='text/javascript'>var timestamp=new Date(document.lastModified); document.getElementById("timestamp").innerHTML = timestamp;</script>
